# Advent of Code 2022

Here are a few working examples in PHP for the 2022 version of [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2022).

## Running
The solution for all days can be run from the command line, ex:

	php run.php [day]

`day` is optional, and can be either a day number, or `all`.
- If it's a number, and the day specified exists, only that day will be run.
- If `all` is specified, all days will be run.
- If omitted, only the latest day will be run.
