# Advent of Code 2022

Here are a few working examples in PHP for the 2022 version of [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2022).

## Running
The solution for all days can be run from the command line, ex:

	php index.php [all]

This will run the solutions (both parts) for either the latest day, or all days if the `all` flag is specified.
